# Heart-Disease-Prediction

📊 Dataset Description
This project utilizes the Heart Disease Dataset, originally compiled from four medical databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes.

🧠 Objective
The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks, where the target variable target indicates:

0: No heart disease

1: Presence of heart disease

🔍 Features Overview
The dataset contains 14 attributes, including the target. The key features used for prediction include:


Feature	Description
age	Age of the patient in years
sex	Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp	Chest pain type (0–3)
trestbps	Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol	Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs	Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2)
thalach	Maximum heart rate achieved
exang	Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise
slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca	Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal	Thalassemia (0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect)
target	Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
📁 Source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and has been used extensively in medical ML research since 1988.
